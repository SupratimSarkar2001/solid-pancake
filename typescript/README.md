# TYPESCRIPT
What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript
- TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with added type annotations. This means it builds on top of JavaScript, allowing you to define the data types of variables and functions, leading to better code reliability and maintainability for larger projects. 
- Compiles into regular JavaScript that runs anywhere JavaScript does.
